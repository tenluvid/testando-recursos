    <section>
        <p>WayV (威神V, WeiShen V) is a 6-member Chinese boy group, formed under Label V, a sub-label of SM Entertainment. WayV debuted on the 17th of January 2019 and consists of members Kun (錕), Ten (李永钦), Winwin (昀昀), Xiaojun (肖俊), Hendery (黄冠亨) and Yangyang (扬扬). Former member Lucas (黃旭熙) left the group on May 10, 2023.</p>

        <p>Fandom name: WayZenNi / Weishennie</p>
        <p>Fandom Colour: Lime/"Neo Pearl Champagne" (to be more specific)</p>
        <p>Official Lightstick: Leekbong/"Green Onion Nightstick"</p>

        <p>WayV stands for: We are your Vision. 威神V (pinyin: WeiShenV) is a bit different in Chinese, but still just as powerful. 威 means “elite” or “prestige” in Mandarin and 神 means “god” or “heavenly body”. Put together, the literal translation is “elite or prestigious gods”, but a more proper interpretation can be “powerful beings”, or a related concept. Either way, “we are your vision” is similar to acknowledging the existence of a higher being, and aspiring to be the best, fullest, and most powerful version of yourself and your dreams.</p>
